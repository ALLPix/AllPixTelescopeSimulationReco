# EXAMPLE CONFIG FOR RUNNING LOCALLY OVER TELESCOPE DATA ONLY
# - configuration for Datura telescope used for test beam campaign in June 2012 at DESY TB21
# - for details see the included README
# - for tests, you can find an example run here:
#   /afs/desy.de/group/telescopes/EutelTestData/TestPysubExampleDaturaAlone/run004118.raw
#   (telescope only data taken with (passive) CMS pixel as DUT)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# global section. Settings can be overwritten through task-specific sections

# The python config parser interprets '%(NAME)s' as the corresponding variable NAME.
# The variable EutelescopePath is by default filled with the environment variable EUTELESCOPE
# and should correspond to the installation path of EUTelescope.
# Also, the variable %(home)s corresponds to the user's home directory.

# the template file name can be set with
# TemplateFile = file.xml
# The default is '[task]-tmp.xml'

# geometry file

# which run number to use for hot pixel determination
